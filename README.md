## Installation

If using JupyterLab, `ipydatagrid` requires JupyterLab version 3 or higher.

You can install `ipydatagrid` using `pip` or `conda`:

Using `pip`:

```bash
pip install ipydatagrid
```

Using `conda`:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge ipydatagrid
```

If you are using Jupyter Notebook 5.2 or earlier, you may also need to enable
the nbextension:

```bash
jupyter nbextension enable --py [--sys-prefix|--user|--system] ipydatagrid
```

NOTE: For examples using Scales from bqplot to work as intended, the bqplot notebook and lab extensions must be installed as well. See the [bqplot repo](https://github.com/bloomberg/bqplot) for installation instructions:

## Development installation

For a development installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bloomberg/ipydatagrid.git
cd ipydatagrid
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Enabling development install for Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter nbextension install --py --symlink --sys-prefix ipydatagrid
jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix ipydatagrid
```

Enabling development install for JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
```

Note for developers: the `--symlink` argument on Linux or OS X allows one to modify the JavaScript code in-place. This feature is not available with Windows.
